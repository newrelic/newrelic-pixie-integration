# New Relic Pixie Integration

The Pixie integration configures Pixie to send a set of curated observability data to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The integration leverages PXL scripts to stream APM metrics and spans from Pixie to New Relic.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a Pixie account and New Relic account setup and have collected the following information:

 * [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key/)
 * [Pixie API key](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/using-pixie/api-quick-start/#get-an-api-token)
 * [Pixie Cluster ID](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/using-pixie/api-quick-start/#get-a-cluster-id)
 * Cluster name: the name of your Kubernetes cluster

## Building

```make build-container```

Docker is required to build the Pixie integration container image.

## Usage

```docker run --env-file ./env.list -it newrelic/pixie-integration:1.0.0```

Define the following environment variables in the `env.list` file:

```
CLUSTER_NAME=

PIXIE_API_KEY=
PIXIE_CLUSTER_ID=

NR_LICENSE_KEY=
NR_OTLP_HOST=staging.otlp.nr-data.net:4317
VERBOSE=true
```

## Testing

After executing the command above Pixie data should be flowing into your New Relic account. Use the following NRQL queries to verify this:

**Metrics**
```
SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE instrumentation.name='pixie'
```

**Spans**
```
SELECT * FROM Span WHERE instrumentation.name='pixie'
```
