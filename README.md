# New Relic Pixie Integration

The Pixie integration connects to the Pixie API and enables the New Relic plugin in Pixie. The plugin then sends data generated by a set of PxL scripts to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry Line Protocol. The integration takes the preset script of the New Relic plugin and enables them for the provided cluster. The integration can be configured to register a set of custom PxL scripts on top of the preset scripts.

Once the New Relic plugin is successfully enabled and the PxL scripts are registered, the integration exits with error code 0.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a Pixie account and a New Relic account set up, and have collected the following information:

* [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key/)
* [Pixie API key](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/using-pixie/api-quick-start/#get-an-api-token) - Using the px CLI: `px api-key create -s`
* [Pixie Cluster ID](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/using-pixie/api-quick-start/#get-a-cluster-id) - Using the px CLI: `px get cluster --id`
* Pixie endpoint - For a [self-hosted Pixie](https://docs.px.dev/installing-pixie/install-guides/self-hosted-pixie/) setup, use `dev.withpixie.dev:443`
* Cluster name - Using the px CLI: `px get viziers`

## Building

```make build-container```

Docker is required to build the Pixie integration container image.

## Usage

```docker run --env-file ./.env -it newrelic/newrelic-pixie-integration:latest```

Define the following environment variables in the `env.list` file:

```
NR_LICENSE_KEY=
PIXIE_API_KEY=
PIXIE_CLUSTER_ID=
PIXIE_ENDPOINT=
CLUSTER_NAME=
```

The following environment variables are optional.

```
HTTP_SPAN_LIMIT=5000
DB_SPAN_LIMIT=1000
COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC=10
HTTP_SPAN_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC=10
JVM_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC=10
MYSQL_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC=10
POSTGRES_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC=10
EXCLUDE_PODS_REGEX=
EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES_REGEX=
SCRIPT_DIR=/scripts
VERBOSE=true
```

The `*_LIMIT` and `*_INTERVAL_SEC` environment variables can be used to control the amount of data that is sent to New Relic. The `COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC` environment variable sets the collection interval for all PxL scripts. The other `*_INTERVAL_SEC` environment variables are overrides for the individual scripts. Setting the interval to `-1` will disable sending that data to New Relic. The smallest valid interval is 2 seconds.

The `EXCLUDE_PODS_REGEX` and `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES_REGEX` environment variables can be configured with [RE2 regular expressions](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) to not send observability data to New Relic for the matching pods and namespaces. When `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES_REGEX` is provided, no data for the matching namespaces will be sent. When `EXCLUDE_PODS_REGEX` is provided, no data for the matching pods (independent of the namespace they are in) will be sent.

Note: If the `docker run` command fails, try disabling the all plugins in the Pixie admin UI (/admin/plugins) before re-running the command.

## Custom scripts

## Testing

### Unit tests

Run the unit tests locally:

```make test```

### End-to-end tests

After executing the command above Pixie data should be flowing into your New Relic account. Use the following NRQL queries to verify this:

**Metrics**

```
SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE instrumentation.provider='pixie'
```

**Spans**

```
SELECT * FROM Span WHERE instrumentation.provider='pixie'
```

## Custom scripts

The integration picks up custom scripts in the `SCRIPT_DIR` (set to `/scripts` by default). The custom scripts should be defined in a yaml file with the `.yaml` extension. The following fields are required:

* name (string): the name of the script
* description (string): description of the script
* frequencyS (int): frequency to execute the script in seconds
* scripts (string): the actual PxL script to execute
* addExcludes (optional boolean, `false` by default): add pod and namespace excludes to the custom script

[This tutorial](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/tutorials/integrations/otel/#write-the-pxl-script) explains how to write custom PxL scripts. Example of a custom script, eg. `/scripts/custom1.yaml`:

```
name: "custom1"
description: "Custom script 1"
frequencyS: 60
script: |
    import px

    df = px.DataFrame(table='http_events', start_time=px.plugin.start_time, end_time=px.plugin.end_time)

    ns_prefix = df.ctx['namespace'] + '/'
    df.container = df.ctx['container_name']
    df.pod = px.strip_prefix(ns_prefix, df.ctx['pod'])
    df.service = px.strip_prefix(ns_prefix, df.ctx['service'])
    df.namespace = df.ctx['namespace']

    df.status_code = df.resp_status

    df = df.groupby(['status_code', 'pod', 'container','service', 'namespace']).agg(
        latency_min=('latency', px.min),
        latency_max=('latency', px.max),
        latency_sum=('latency', px.sum),
        latency_count=('latency', px.count),
        time_=('time_', px.max),
    )

    df.latency_min = df.latency_min / 1000000
    df.latency_max = df.latency_max / 1000000
    df.latency_sum = df.latency_sum / 1000000

    df.cluster_name = px.vizier_name()
    df.cluster_id = px.vizier_id()
    df.pixie = 'pixie'

    px.export(
    df, px.otel.Data(
        resource={
        'service.name': df.service,
        'k8s.container.name': df.container,
        'service.instance.id': df.pod,
        'k8s.pod.name': df.pod,
        'k8s.namespace.name': df.namespace,
        'px.cluster.id': df.cluster_id,
        'k8s.cluster.name': df.cluster_name,
        'instrumentation.provider': df.pixie,
        },
        data=[
        px.otel.metric.Summary(
            name='http.server.duration',
            description='measures the duration of the inbound HTTP request',
            # Unit is not supported yet
            # unit='ms',
            count=df.latency_count,
            sum=df.latency_sum,
            quantile_values={
            0.0: df.latency_min,
            1.0: df.latency_max,
            },
            attributes={
            'http.status_code': df.status_code,
            },
        )],
    ),
    )
```

The `addExcludes` adds a filtering section to the script right before the call to `px.export`. For example if `EXCLUDE_PODS_REGEX` is set to `team-1-.*`, the following line will be added to the PxL script:

```
df = df[not px.regex_match('team-1-.*', df.pod)]
```

 The filtering code requires your PxL script to:

* Use `df` as the exported dataframe
* The dataframe `df` to have a `pod` field (for `EXCLUDE_PODS_REGEX`)
* The dataframe `df` to have a `namespace` field (for `EXCLUDE_NAMESPACE_REGEX`)

If the above requirements do not hold for your script, setting `addExcludes` to `true` will break the script.

## Script registration behaviour

The integration will consider scripts that start with `nri-` as managed by the integration. Scripts are registered per cluster and follow the `nri-<script name>-<cluster name>` pattern. The integration updates the scripts to bring them in-sync with the provided configuration. Scripts that are no longer present in the configuration are deleted. If you already have scripts that start with `nri-`, the integration will remove these if they are not specified in the integration configuration.

A cluster name can only be used for a single cluster. Scripts that follow the `nri-<script name>-<cluster name>` pattern with the same `<cluster-name>` but that were registered from another cluster will be overwritten or deleted.
